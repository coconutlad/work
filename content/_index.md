# A field manual for work
Helps you masquerade as a software developer. Use at your own risk. üçä

## Fun facts
Idk what else to put on this page so here are some random nice things:
* You can hit `.` when you're on a GitHub repo to bring it an online VSCode instance (on [github.dev](https://github.dev)) to edit the files. You can't run anything tho cuz that's a paid feature.
* [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com) is building a really cool developer experience where you can do local web development without installing node and stuff on your local system. You can even share these instances!

## Note
This site isn't complete yet. It will never really be, but it isn't even ready for use. The extra section about shortcodes and the slightly weird arrangement is because I'm still learning how to use this theme.
