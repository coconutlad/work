# A field manual for work
Helps you masquerade as a software developer. Use at your own risk. 🍊

## Fun facts
Idk what else to put on this page so here are some random nice things:
* You can hit `>` when you're on a GitHub repo to bring it an online VSCode instance (on [github.dev](https://github.dev)) to edit the files. You can't run anything tho cuz that's a paid feature.
There are many more keyboard shortcuts. You can see them by hitting `?`.
* [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com) is building a really cool developer experience where you can do local web development without installing node and stuff on your local system. You can even share these instances!
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an auto code-formatter for web-dev
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a linter that you can run (via the terminal or editor) on your code to catch possible bugs
* [npx](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner/) is really cool! You can run the angular cli without installing it like so: `npx @angular/cli new facebook --skip-git`.
* An easy way to locally deploy the built application is to run: `python -m http.server --bind localhost 8080` which serves the current directory at `http://localhost:8080`
* You can add [graphs and diagrams to markdown files in GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) with [Mermaid!](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
* npm is not an acronym (it once was, not anymore) and must be written down in all lowercase :P
* Want a notepad in your browser? Paste this in the address bar of a new tab:  
`data:text/html, <body style="margin: 0;"><textarea style="font-size: 3rem; width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; color: white; background-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); border: none; outline: none;" autofocus>`
* [There's a standard for dates](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): YYYY-MM-DD
* [Python has a good set of builtin modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
* Whenever you contribute to a repo on GitHub your contributions fall under the same license as the repo.
[As described in GitHub's TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) 
* Google drive has a good range of keyboard shortcuts. You can view them by presing
`Shift`+`\` or [from this nice support link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2563044).
* While building SaaS (stuff as a service), it might be useful to look at https://12factor.net/.
* Want to refactor your code? Check out <https://refactoring.guru/refactoring>
* There's a slight imperfection in the microsoft logo on black backgrounds
where the red box seems to appear larger than the blue box below it. This is due to the way pixels
are arranged in a display. [See it in more detail here](https://www.avforums.com/threads/anyone-else-have-an-offset-blue-and-red-square-on-the-microsoft-logo-of-office-2019.2310709/)

## Note
This manual thing is pretty unrefined. It's like v0.2.0 rn.  
P.S. ([Check out semver](https://semver.org/))

## C++ notes
Some notes from a university course on sort-of-advanced C++: [cpp-notes](/pdfs/cpp-notes.pdf)
Yes it does say "Generic Programming" and that's a part of it
but most of is just about C++ and not just it's generic programming abilities.
