# A field manual for work
Helps you masquerade as a software developer. Use at your own risk. üçä

## Fun facts
Idk what else to put on this page so here are some random nice things:
* You can hit `.` when you're on a GitHub repo to bring it an online VSCode instance (on [github.dev](https://github.dev)) to edit the files. You can't run anything tho cuz that's a paid feature.
* [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com) is building a really cool developer experience where you can do local web development without installing node and stuff on your local system. You can even share these instances!
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an auto code-formatter for web-dev
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a linter that you can run (via the terminal or editor) on your code to catch possible bugs
* [npx](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner/) is really cool! You can run the angular cli without installing it like so: `npx @angular/cli new facebook --skip-git`.
* An easy way to locally deploy the built application is to run: `python -m http.server --bind localhost 8080` which serves the current directory at `http://localhost:8080`
* You can add [graphs and diagrams to markdown files in GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) with [Mermaid!](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
* npm is not an acronym (it once was, not anymore) and must be written down in all lowercase :P

## Note
The slightly weird arrangement is because I'm still learning how to use this theme.
