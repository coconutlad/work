# A field manual for work
Helps you masquerade as a software developer. Use at your own risk. 🍊

## Fun facts
Idk what else to put on this page so here are some random nice things:
* You can hit `>` when you're on a GitHub repo to bring it an online VSCode instance (on [github.dev](https://github.dev)) to edit the files. You can't run anything tho cuz that's a paid feature.
There are many more keyboard shortcuts. You can see them by hitting `?`.
* [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com) is building a really cool developer experience where you can do local web development without installing node and stuff on your local system. You can even share these instances!
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an auto code-formatter for web-dev
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a linter that you can run (via the terminal or editor) on your code to catch possible bugs
* [npx](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-npx-nodejs-package-runner/) is really cool! You can run the angular cli without installing it like so: `npx @angular/cli new facebook --skip-git`.
* You can add [graphs and diagrams to markdown files in GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) with [Mermaid!](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
* npm is not an acronym (it once was, not anymore) and must be written down in all lowercase :P
* Talking about npm and node, it can be difficult to manage multiple versions of them
on your system. [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a good manager for Linux/Mac while [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is a good one for Windows.
* Want a notepad in your browser? Paste this in the address bar of a new tab:  
`data:text/html, <body style="margin: 0;"><textarea style="font-size: 3rem; width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 1rem; color: white; background-color: rgb(32, 32, 32); border: none; outline: none;" autofocus>`
* [There's a standard for dates](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html): YYYY-MM-DD
* [Python has a good set of builtin modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
* Whenever you contribute to a repo on GitHub your contributions fall under the same license as the repo.
[As described in GitHub's TOS](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) 
* Google drive has a good range of keyboard shortcuts. You can view them by presing
`Shift`+`\` or [from this nice support link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2563044).
* While building SaaS (stuff as a service), it might be useful to look at https://12factor.net/.
* Want to refactor your code? Check out <https://refactoring.guru/refactoring>
* You shouldn't really be writing algorithms and memory management code in C++ anymore. [Use the builtin stuff](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/cheat_sheets.html)
* Talking about C++, here is some weird stuff about the language: [cpp-iceberg](https://fouronnes.github.io/cppiceberg/)
* Want to see learn about the SOLID principles with some real code? [Check out this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB30aXS77U)

## Note
This manual thing is pretty unrefined. It's like v0.2.0 rn.

## C++ notes
Some notes from a university course on sort-of-advanced C++: [cpp-notes](/pdfs/cpp-notes.pdf)
Yes it does say "Generic Programming" and that's a part of it
but most of is just about C++ and not just it's generic programming abilities.
