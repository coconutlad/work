## What is this? Why is this?

As much as I like Stackoverflow and Google and the work they've done, it's still hard to find exactly the right information exactly when you want it.
<!--more-->

I think that is because we are all at different stages in software development and have varied knowledge about things. You might know more about CSS Grids than someone else and they might know more about JavaScript requests. You probably even understand things differently and have different mental models.
That's why I'm writing this. (Also because writing things down helps you remember stuff.)

### These are notes, basically
Yeah, that's about it. Notes by me, taken from random sources, for me. You are free to use them and even suggest edits (through GitHub) if you like.

Oh also, this theme is crazy good and has a lot of features. It's gonna take me a while to make use of all of them and reach a good level of productivity.

Have fun! ðŸ™‚
