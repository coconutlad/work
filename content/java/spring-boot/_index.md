# Wat
I want to learn Spring Boot as it seems to be a very popular backend.
It seems that it is an advancement of the Spring Framework. So I'm gonna try to learn that first.

## What's Spring
Spring is a collection of projects like Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data, Spring Security etc.
Spring Framework is the most popular Java framework. What exactly does it do? Let's find out.

## Learning Journey
As usual, start off with a nice plurarlsight course to get an overview and pratcise:
[Spring Framework: Spring 5 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spring-framework-spring-fundamentals/)

Then deep dive through the [Baeldung Spring tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-tutorial).

One of the core concepts seems to be that of dependency injection.
Baeldung's got a tutorial for that!
[Dependency Injection in Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-dependency-injection)

Finally, time to learn Spring Boot.
[Spring Boot tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot) and a project too.

What project? A shopping cart with the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)

Some offical resources:
* [Spring Boot reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html)
* [An overview of Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html)
