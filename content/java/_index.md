# Java
The corporate programming language.

It's not so bad tbh. It's got a large ecosystem of supporting projects and is somewhat easier to use than C++.

People claim that the JVM has been optimized so much over the years that Java programs aren't that slow anymore.

I know a decent amount of Java, but not enough. I still don't know what classpaths and packages are.
This is an attempt to "formally" understand the language and the ecosystem.

## Plan
* [An overview of modern java](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/modern-java-big-picture/table-of-contents)
* [Setting up a development environment](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/setting-up-java-development-environment/table-of-contents)
* [Memory management in the JVM](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/understanding-java-vm-memory-management/table-of-contents). There are other JVM courses too, they seem interesting.
* [Java 17](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skill/java-se-17). Some things are new in the latest LTS, check out how they can help.
* [Baeldung's series](https://www.baeldung.com/java-tutorial) covers a lot of topics. Check out some of the new stuff there.

## Do something with this?
So many courses and tutorials. What do I do with this knowledge? ðŸ¤”
