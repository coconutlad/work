# Java
The corporate programming language.

It's not so bad tbh. It's got a large ecosystem of supporting projects and is somewhat easier to use than C++.

People claim that the JVM has been optimized so much over the years that Java programs aren't that slow anymore.

I know a decent amount of Java, but not enough. I still don't know what classpaths and packages are.
This is an attempt to "formally" understand the language and the ecosystem.

## Plan
* [Setting up a development environment](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/setting-up-java-development-environment/table-of-contents).
* Learn a bit about the internals of the JVM.
* [A playbook for common tasks](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-se-17-playbook/table-of-contents).
* [Refactoring code](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-se-17-refactoring-solid-code/table-of-contents) according to SOLID principles.

Is this too unorganized? There's a more structured way to learn Java : [dev.java](https://dev.java/learn/) that you could follow.

## Do something with this?
So many courses and tutorials. What do I do with this knowledge? ðŸ¤”

## Fun facts
There's a bunch of FAQs on the Collections API. [About their design](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/doc-files/coll-designfaq.html).
