Nice island.

Here's some fun stuff to read:
* What distinguishes REST from other architectures? [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)

* How to manage JDK installations on your Linux machine? Use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/usage).
Which is sort of like `nvm` but it also manages versions of Java SDKs like Gradle, Groovy, Scala, Apache Tomcat etc. Sounds more like `apt` now.

* Want to revise your basics in Java? Check this out : <https://www.baeldung.com/java-tutorial>

What's more, it lets you set SDKs per project too.
