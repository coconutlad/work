# Data Driven Docs?
While it's a good library overall, I'm learning how to make network graphs with it.
Here goes nothing ðŸ˜›

Oooh, this is one crazy library with a heck lot of things it can do. Nice confusion.
These might be some good resources:
* [Official tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@d3/learn-d3)
* [Huge collection of tutorials](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials)
* I like Pluralsight. Videos can be helpful y'know.
[This course seems updated](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/d3-data-visualization-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* [An updated D3 tutorial](https://www.d3indepth.com/) (taken from the GitHub list) should also help!
