# Data Driven Docs?
It's a powerful library with a bit of a learning curve.
I'm learning how to make network graphs with it.
Here goes nothing ðŸ˜›

Oooh, there a heck lot of things it can do. Nice confusion.
These might be some good resources:
* [Official tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@d3/learn-d3)
* [Huge collection of tutorials](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials)
* I like Pluralsight. Videos can be helpful y'know.
[This course seems updated](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/d3-data-visualization-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* [An updated D3 tutorial](https://www.d3indepth.com/) (taken from the GitHub list) should also help!

## Selection
One feature of d3 is the ability to select and modify the DOM.

Core to this are `select` and `selectAll` which take in an HTML Element or a CSS selector.
Both return a `Selection` object.

[API](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md#selections-d3-selection) for selecting and selections.

### Properties

The object has a few functions, each of which return a `Selection` object
(that means chaining is possible)
| Function      | Params                | Description       |
| -----------   | -----------           | -----------       |
| style         | 'css-prop', value     | Sets a css property |
| attr          | 'html-attr', value    | Sets an attribute on the HTML element |
| classed       | 'classname', value    | Removes or adds class depending on value |
| property      | 'html-prop', value    | Sets HTML attributes which can't be set by 'attr'. E.g. `checked` on a checkbox |
| text          | value                 | Sets the text within a HTML element |
| html          | value                 | Sets HTML within the selected element |
| select        | CSS selector          | Can be used to select child elements |

`value` can be an actual value or a function. The function takes in two params:
* `d` the datum, which is the data value corresponding to the index
* `i` the index of the element among other elements in the Selection.

Its possible to add an event to the Selection with the `on` property like so:
```js
d3.select('rect')
  .on('hover', function(event, datum) { // can be any DOM event
    // `this` inside this function refers to the HTMLElement
    // to get a d3 Selction from it you must do d3.select(this)
  }); 
```

{{< hint "danger" >}}
Because of the way `this` works inside arrow functions,
don't use arrow functions for the callback of `on` if you want to use `this`.

When it comes to D3, it might just be a good idea to use `function` for most use cases.
{{< /hint >}}

### Insertion / Deletion
Its possible to insert / remove DOM elements with D3. The functions are:
* `.append('element-tag')` creates the specified element as the last child of the selection
* `.insert('element-tag', 'css-selector')` same as append
but it places this element before the CSS selector specified
* `.remove` removes the element(s) in the Selection from the DOM

### Processing
A Selection can be processed in these ways:
* `.each(function(d, i){}` calls the function for each element.
* `.call(function(theSelection){})` calls the function once for the selection.
It passes the selection object as an argument.
* `.filter(function(d, i){})` calls the function for each element.
It returns a new selection that only contains elements that returned true in the filter function.
* `.sort(function(datumA, datumB){})` sorts the elements in the DOM with the comparator function.

## Data Joins
Modifying visual elements according to data in a declarative manner. It usually works like this:
* Create a Selection of the parent element which will hold the visual elements.
* Create an empty Selection with `.selectAll('element-to-join')`.
* Create a Selection with data by calling the `data` method on it with an array as the argument.
* On the latest selection call `.join('element-to-insert')`

[Article to help with understanding joins](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/).
[Another article. This one's about modern joins](https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join)

### Selection Join
This join automatically appends and removes elements but also provides the ability for fine control.
A sample:
```js
d3.select('g')
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(array)
  .join('circle')
  .attr('fill', 'blue');
```
To control what happens to enter, update and exit elements, pass functions as args to it like so:
```js
selexon.join(
  function(enterSelection){},
  function(updateSelection){},
  function(exitSelection){}
)
```

### Keys
It's possible to make sure that DOM elements are exactly matched with the same data
even if the elements are moved around.
This is possible via a key function which assigns keys to DOM elements based on the data they get like so:

```js
xyz.data(array, function(d){ /* return unique id */ })
```

## Enter, Exit & Update
This picture from https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/ is a good explanation:
![Data join chart](/images/d3joinchart.png)

This way of joining is fine-grained but it can be tedious. It's mainly used for transitions.
A more concise way is using the new selection join (D3 v5+).

An example. Given a DOM like:
```html
<svg>
  <g>
    <circle></circle>
    <circle></circle>
  </g>
</svg>
```
Circles can be selected like so:
```js
let data = [10, 8, 15];
let circs = d3.select('g').selectAll('circle');
```
Existing elements can be joined with data like so:
```js
circs.data(data).attr('r', d => 2*d);
```
New elements can be created for extra datum:
```js
circs.data(data).enter().append('circle')
```
Elements which don't have a datum:
```js
circs.data(data).exit()
```

## Scales
Scales provide a way to map values from a domain to a range. They can be continuous or discrete.
(There's no scale for D to C though).

Usually the domain consits of data values and the range consists of visual properties 
(height, position, color, etc.)

### C to C
There are many scales here: Linear, Quadratic, Log, Exponential, etc. An example:
```js
let scale = d3.scaleLog();
scale.domain([1, 100]);
scale.range([0, 1]);
let scaledVal = scale(50);
```
For fancy colors there's also `d3.scaleSequential()` which instead of a range, has an interpolator.
E.g. `scale.interpolate(d3.interpolateRainbow)`

### C to D
A straightforward function is `.scaleQuantize()` which splits the domain into equal divisons among the range.
It also clamps inputs into the domain.

To split the domain into specific groups `.scaleThreshold()` can be used.
`.domain([/* array of n values */])` will create `n+1` groups (\<arr[0], >arr[0] & arr[1]<, ... arr[n-1]<).
They are matched one-one with the range items. If there aren't enough elements in the range,
the groups are allocated to the last item.

### D to D
The simplest way to do this is `.scaleOrdinal()` where the elements in domain are allocated on range element.
If there aren't enough range elements the array repeats.
If the value to be scaled doesn't exist in the domain, the scale will automatically add it.
To prevent it from being added, specify a default value to be returned for unknown elements with
`scale.unknown(value)`

There are other functions too like `.scaleBand()` and `.scalePoint()`.

## Shapes & Lines
D3 has generator functions to generate paths that represent  line graphs, pie charts, curves, and more.
This works using the `<path>` SVG tag and setting its `d` (data) attribute to a special strings
returned by the functions which contain instructions on how to draw the required shapes.

### Common generators
| Name | Description | Configurable params |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `line` | Simple line graph | `x`, `y` for each point in the line |
| `radialLine` | Like a line graph but instead of going left to right, it goes around a center | `angle`, `radius` for each point around the center |
| `area` | Area between two lines (need not be straight lines) | `x`, `y0` for top line, and `y1` for bottom |
| `radialArea` | Like how radialLine is to line | `angle`, `innerRadius`, and `outerRadius` |

The configurable params can either be a function that takes in one value and returns a value,
or it can be a value. E.g. `lineGenerator.x(909)` and `lineGenerator.x(d => d+10)` both work.

Example usage:
```js
let inputData = [/* complex objects */]
let lineGen = d3.line();
lineGen.x(arrayVal => arrayVal.prop1 + 10)
lineGen.y(arrayVal => arrayVal.prop2 - 5)
let pathData = lineGen(inputData);
d3.select('path').attr('d', pathData)
```

Instead of passing an array of objects and configuring each param,
the user can also just feed an array of arrays to the generator.

To handle invalid data in the array, the user can set `.defined(datum => {})` on the generator.
D3 will skip the element if the callback function returns false for it.

Interpolation of the points can be changed by calling `.curve(someCoolCurveGen)` on the generator.
Check out some popular curves [in the docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves).

## Axes
These help give the user a scale of the data. An axis can be created in a container like `<g>`.
Select the container. Create an axis with `.axis[Left|Right|Top|Bottom](scale)`.

The scale's domain determines the ticks on the graph and the range helps determine its length.
The axis can then be passed to the container Selection like so: `gSel.call(axis)`. That's it!

It isn't limited to uniform ticks. Different scales like `.scaleSqrt()` can be used with axes.
To make the axis look better, the domain can be rounded to "nice" values like so:
`d3.scaleLinear().domain([11, 39]).nice()` will change to domain to (10, 40).

The number of ticks can be changed by `axis.ticks(n)` or even set tick values like 
`axis.tickValues([a, b, c, d])`. The label of each tick can be formatted with something like 
`.tickFormat(d => "-"+d)`

## Hierarchies
There are multiple layouts here such as tree,
cluster (just like a tree but all the leaves are on the same horizontal level), treemap, and so on.
This section will focus on the tree layout.

It uses the output of `d3.hierarchy`, a nested object, to layout the tree.
`hierarchy` itself needs a nested object as input or a map of maps.

### `hierarchy`
Given an input with the format discussed above, `hierarchy` returns a nested object
where each object (node) has the following params:
* `data` : The item in the input data that this node is associated with. E.g. a map key and its value.
* `children` : array of references to children (not present in leaf nodes)
* `depth`
* `height`
* `parent` : reference to parent node

It also has methods like:
* `descendants` : Returns an array of all its descendants
* `ancestors` : Returns an array of all its ancestors
* `links` : Returns an array of all links under this subtree. A link looks like
```
{
  source: reference to source node object,
  target: reference to target node object
}
```

### Tree Layout
A tree layout function can be created like so: `let funk = d3.tree()`.
The size this element will take in the DOM can be set like so: `funk.size([ht, wd])`.
The **layout can then be applied to the hierarchy object** like so: `funk(hierarchyOutput)`.

The tree's size need not be set explicitly, instead, a combination of `.nodeSize([ht, wd])` which
sets the minimum space a node must be alloted, and `.separation((a, b) => 1)` which sets the
the space between two nodes in terms of nodeSize
(e.g. 3 means a and b will be separated by the space that 3 nodes would occupy)

Applying a layout means it will add extra properties (display properties e.g. x and y locations)
to each node in the hierarchy.

Now that the object has display properties, it can be used to create DOM nodes and position them.
#### Nodes
Use the `rootNode.descendants()` array along with a join for whatever shape you like (e.g. "circle").

#### Edges
Use the `rootNode.links()` array along with a join which creates lines with "path".


## Transitions
When data gets updated, elements might have new places, might look different, or even vanish.
Without smooth transitions, the transitions looks janky and not "natural".

To have a transition just call `transition()` on the Selection before calling any `attr` methods
for which you want a transition.

Could be position (e.g. 'x', 'cx'), color (e.g. 'fill'), or
even size (e.g. 'r'). It creates a transition Selection which has a few more methods
and it automatically creates a transition when the join runs.

A delay can be added by calling `delay(durationInMilli)`.
A duration for the transition can be set with `duration(durationInMilli)`

Instead of setting a constant duration both the functions can take a callback function
which can set determine the value according to some factor e.g. `(d, i) => i*1000`

Calling `transition()` a second time in the Selection chain will cause the second one to play out
after the first one has finished.

To put separate transitions for enter, exit, and update elements, use separate functions for the join
and apply `transition()` within them where required. E.g.
```js
coolSelection.join(
  function(enterSelect) {
    enterSelect.transition()
      .attr('r', d => d+10)
  },
  function(updateSelect) {
    updateSelect.transition()
      .attr('fill', 'green')
  },
  function(exitSelect) {
    exitSelect.transition()
      .remove()
  }
)
```

There are other topics too but this should be enough to get started.
