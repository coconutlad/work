# Data Driven Docs?
While it's a good library overall, I'm learning how to make network graphs with it.
Here goes nothing ðŸ˜›

Oooh, this is one crazy library with a heck lot of things it can do. Nice confusion.
These might be some good resources:
* [Official tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@d3/learn-d3)
* [Huge collection of tutorials](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials)
* I like Pluralsight. Videos can be helpful y'know.
[This course seems updated](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/d3-data-visualization-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* [An updated D3 tutorial](https://www.d3indepth.com/) (taken from the GitHub list) should also help!

## Selection
One feature of d3 is the ability to select and modify the DOM.

Core to this are `select` and `selectAll` which take in an HTML Element or a CSS selector.
Both return a `Selection` object.

[API](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/API.md#selections-d3-selection) for selecting and selections.

### Properties

The object has a few functions, each of which return a `Selection` object
(that means chaining is possible)
| Function      | Params                | Description       |
| -----------   | -----------           | -----------       |
| style         | 'css-prop', value     | Sets a css property |
| attr          | 'html-attr', value    | Sets an attribute on the HTML element |
| classed       | 'classname', value    | Removes or adds class depending on value |
| property      | 'html-prop', value    | Sets HTML attributes which can't be set by 'attr'. E.g. `checked` on a checkbox |
| text          | value                 | Sets the text within a HTML element |
| html          | value                 | Sets HTML within the selected element |
| select        | CSS selector          | Can be used to select child elements |

`value` can be an actual value or a function. The function takes in two params:
* `d` the datum, which is the data value corresponding to the index
* `i` the index of the element among other elements in the Selection.

Its possible to add an event to the Selection with the `on` property like so:
```js
d3.select('rect')
  .on('hover', function(event, datum) { // can be any DOM event
    // `this` inside this function refers to the HTMLElement
    // to get a d3 Selction from it you must do d3.select(this)
  }); 
```

Because of the way `this` works inside arrow functions,
don't use arrow functions for the callback of `on`.
{{< /hint >}}

### Insertion / Deletion
Its possible to insert / remove DOM elements with D3. The functions are:
* `.append('element-tag')` creates the specified element as the last child of the selection
* `.insert('element-tag', 'css-selector')` same as append
but it places this element before the CSS selector specified
* `.remove` removes the element(s) in the Selection from the DOM

### Processing
A Selection can be processed in these ways:
* `.each(function(d, i){}` calls the function for each element.
* `.call(function(theSelection){})` calls the function once for the selection.
It passes the selection object as an argument.
* `.filter(function(d, i){})` calls the function for each element.
It returns a new selection that only contains elements that returned true in the filter function.
* `.sort(function(datumA, datumB){})` sorts the elements in the DOM with the comparator function.

## Data Joins
Modifying visual elements according to data in a declarative manner. It usually works like this:
* Create a Selection of the parent element which will hold the visual elements.
* Create an empty Selection with `.selectAll('element-to-join')`.
* Create a Selection with data by calling the `data` method on it with an array as the argument.
* On the latest selection call `.join('element-to-insert')`

[Article to help with understanding joins](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/).
[Another article. This one's about modern joins](https://observablehq.com/@d3/selection-join)

### Selection Join
This join automatically appends and removes elements but also provides the ability for fine control.
A sample:
```js
d3.select('g')
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(array)
  .join('circle')
  .attr('fill', 'blue');
```
To control what happens to enter, update and exit elements, pass functions as args to it like so:
```js
selexon.join(
  function(enterSelection){},
  function(updateSelection){},
  function(exitSelection){}
)
```

### Keys
It's possible to make sure that DOM elements are exactly matched with the same data
even if the elements are moved around.
This is possible via a key function which assigns keys to DOM elements based on the data they get like so:

```js
xyz.data(array, function(d){ /* return unique id */ })
```

## Enter, Exit & Update
This picture from https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/ is a good explanation:
![Data join chart](/images/d3joinchart.png)
This way of joining is fine-grained but it can be tedious. It's mainly used for transitions.
A more concise way is using the new selection join (D3 v5+).

An example. Given a DOM like:
```html
<svg>
  <g>
    <circle></circle>
    <circle></circle>
  </g>
</svg>
```
Circles can be selected like so:
```js
let data = [10, 8, 15];
let circs = d3.select('g').selectAll('circle');
```
Existing elements can be joined with data like so:
```js
circs.data(data).attr('r', d => 2*d);
```
New elements can be created for extra datum:
```js
circs.data(data).enter().append('circle')
```
Elements which don't have a datum:
```js
circs.data(data).exit()
```

## Scales
Scales provide a way to map values from a domain to a range. They can be continuous or discrete.
(There's no scale for D to C though).

Usually the domain consits of data values and the range consists of visual properties 
(height, position, color, etc.)

### C to C
There are many scales here: Linear, Quadratic, Log, Exponential, etc. An example:
```js
let scale = d3.scaleLog();
scale.domain([1, 100]);
scale.range([0, 1]);
let scaledVal = scale(50);
```
For fancy colors there's also `d3.scaleSequential()` which instead of a range, has an interpolator.
E.g. `scale.interpolate(d3.interpolateRainbow)`

### C to D
A straightforward function is `.scaleQuantize()` which splits the domain into equal divisons among the range.
It also clamps inputs into the domain.

To split the domain into specific groups `.scaleThreshold()` can be used.
`.domain([/* array of n values */])` will create `n+1` groups (\<arr[0], >arr[0] & arr[1]<, ... arr[n-1]<).
They are matched one-one with the range items. If there aren't enough elements in the range,
the groups are allocated to the last item.

### D to D
The simplest way to do this is `.scaleOrdinal()` where the elements in domain are allocated on range element.
If there aren't enough range elements the array repeats.
If the value to be scaled doesn't exist in the domain, the scale will automatically add it.
To prevent it from being added, specify a default value to be returned for unknown elements with
`scale.unknown(value)`

There are other functions too like `.scaleBand()` and `.scalePoint()`.

## Fancy paths
D3 has generator functions to generate paths that represent  line graphs, pie charts, curves, and more.
This works using the `<path>` SVG tag and setting its `d` (data) attribute to a special strings
returned by the functions which contain instructions on how to draw the required shapes.

### Common generators
| Name | Description | Configurable params |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `line` | Simple line graph | `x`, `y` for each point in the line |
| `radialLine` | Like a line graph but instead of going left to right, it goes around a center | `angle`, `radius` for each point around the center |
| `area` | Area between two lines (need not be straight lines) | `x`, `y0` for top line, and `y1` for bottom |
| `radialArea` | Like how radialLine is to line | `angle`, `innerRadius`, and `outerRadius` |

The configurable params can either be a function that takes in one value and returns a value,
or it can be a value. E.g. `lineGenerator.x(909)` and `lineGenerator.x(d => d+10)` both work.

Instead of passing an array of objects and configuring each param,
the user can also just feed an array of arrays.

E.g. if `.line()` has `.x` and `.y` to set, a user could also just feed an array like
`.line([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [8.2, 7]])`

To handle invalid data in the array, the user can set `.defined(datum => {})` on the `.line()` object.
D3 will skip the element if the callback function returns false for it.

Interpolation of the points can be changed by calling `.curve(someCoolCurveGen)` on the generator.
