# So much to learn üòÆ
I think I should learn these things because they might be useful at work:

* Common design patterns (with examples?)
* Should add a lifecycle section to Angular? Maybe just link to the [docs?](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)
* Add more content about Angular services (really needed?)
* TypeScript, since it's the default lang for Angular. [Just an overview from a YT video perhaps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCg4U1FzODs)
* Search for "TODO" in the Angular notes and do those parts
* For the Angular docs do it in this order: Understanding Angular" -> "Reference/Conceptual Reference"
* ngModel is one fancy thing. [Check out the docs](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) to understand it.
* Get an overview of what design is about [from this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBUJYEQ7OGY).
* Learn how to use penpot [with their YT tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpINco5nWw4&list=PLgcCPfOv5v57cJS0im5FYFwbsu6X5mkNq). [This walkthrough can give a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUg3xIFWK_g).
* Note down points from [Brad's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o) [Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o) and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYFwcIRx16g) [Kevin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLMEdiKuMg).

No rush, gonna add things whenever I feel the need to (I believe that is the best way for me to learn) üçÉ.
