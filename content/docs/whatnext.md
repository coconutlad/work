# So much to learn 😮
I think I should learn these things because they might be useful at work:

* Common design patterns (with examples?)
* Should add a lifecycle section to angular? Maybe just link to the [docs?](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)

No rush, gonna add things whenever I feel the need to (I believe that is the best way for me to learn) 🍃.
