# Angular, the fancy web framework
I gotta use this for work lol. I heard that some people hate it. Not my problem. If it works, it works.

## Base
Where am I starting from? Why is that important? It defines what kind of content will be in this manual. I know *nothing* about Angular. I know a bare minimum of HTML, CSS, and JS. ðŸ˜° let's see how this goes. YOLO ðŸ™‚.

## Course stuff
I'm following along [The Angular Fundamentals course on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-fundamentals).
The authors have nice practice exercises [available on their website](https://jcoop.io/angular-practice-exercises/).
[Code for the course is available on GitHub](https://github.com/jmcooper/angular-fundamentals-files).

This [Crash Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8) is also very good.

Finally, [The Angular docs](https://angular.io/docs) are very good.

Just to note, the content I put up here is whatever I understood out of the courses and many other sources off the internet. I haven't and I won't, purposefully, rip content off sources I haven't listed here. I try to write this stuff on my own but sometimes, when it comes to things like specs and such, they do need to be put in word for word.

## Fun stuff
Some cool things I learnt along the way:
* The JSON pipe is useful when you want to display an object in a template.
Use it like this: `{{ objkt | json }}`
* To see what happens when you run an `ng` command, suffix it with `--dry-run`
