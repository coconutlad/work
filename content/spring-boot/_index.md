# Spring Boot
To display dynamic data on web pages, the page usually sources it from a server running a back-end framework.
While python's got plenty of back-end frameworks that are easy to use (e.g., FastAPI), Spring Boot seems to be more popular and more performant.
Might be a good idea to learn that.
Apparently, it is the next iteration of the Spring Framework. So I should probably look into that first.

## What's Spring
Spring is a collection of projects like Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data, Spring Security etc.
Spring Framework is the most popular Java framework. What exactly does it do? Let's find out.

## Learning Journey
As usual, there's a helpful Pluralsight course to get an overview and pratcise:
[Spring Framework: Spring 5 Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/spring-framework-spring-fundamentals/)

Go through the [Baeldung Spring tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-tutorial).

One of the core concepts seems to be that of dependency injection.
Baeldung's got a tutorial for that!
[Dependency Injection in Spring](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-dependency-injection)

Finally, time to learn Spring Boot.
[Spring Boot tutorial](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot) and a project too.

What project? A shopping cart with the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)

// TODO: seems like there should be more projects

Some offical resources:
* [Spring Boot reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html)
* [An overview of Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html)

## Fun stuff

Here's some fun stuff to read:
* What distinguishes REST from other architectures? [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)

* How to manage JDK installations on your Linux machine? Use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/usage).
Which is sort of like `nvm` but it also manages versions of Java SDKs like Gradle, Groovy, Scala, Apache Tomcat etc. Sounds more like `apt` now.

What's more, it lets you set SDKs per project too.
