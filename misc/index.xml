      <description>Data Driven Docs? # It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful library with a bit of a learning curve.
There a heck lot of things it can do. Nice confusion. These might be some good resources:
An updated D3 tutorial (This was the best!) Official tutorial (It can take some time to get used to observableHQ&amp;rsquo;s notebooks) Huge collection of tutorials https://wattenberger.com/blog/d3#intro [SUGGESTION]: Do the d3indepth tutorial first and practise a bit by trying to make your own visualizations.</description>

      <description>Write JavaScript with confidence # TODO: The docs are good. Check them out: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/.
Some notes # declare a in TS is used to tell the compiler that the variable a is declared somewhere else and it&amp;rsquo;s usage in this file should not throw an error. (e.g. it&amp;rsquo;s declared in another file and both of them are used via script tags in HTML)
Any definitions in a class declaration are moved to the constructor when the code is transpiled to JS.</description>

      <description>Tips, tricks, and resources # Modern JS has many inbuilt features, not all of them are so well known. Check them out, from the stateOfJS22
Good resource &amp;amp; book on how to design modern web apps: https://www.patterns.dev/
Variable hoisting was an unintended addition that came along with function hoisting when JS was being developed. Hoisting is done by the two-scan interpreter. The first scan is to find declarations. This stackoverflow q&amp;amp;a has some good answers.</description>
